The game mechanics are simple in the first level, normal zombies will appear then the game gets harder when the player hits a certain score. 
It will also automatically upgrade the ship and its bullet damage. 
There are three zombies, these are normal , runner, and armor. 
Above all that, there is one rule to keep in mind, don't let the zombies get near in the line of the ship, 
but if the zombies happen to get near, the game is over.
